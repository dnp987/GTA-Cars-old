This is pseudo code for stopping when the last page is reached
																	1st pass			2nd pass		3rd pass
																	current  next	current  next	current  next
load page using spreadsheet URL			
wait for the heading/title to load
current_page = 1
remaining_pages = true
While remaining_pages:
	next_page = next_page-href				1			 2			2			 3			3			2
	if next_page < current_page				false				false				true - break
		break
	
	next_page.click # get the next page
	wait for the heading/title to load
	current_page = next_page					2			2			3          3

last_page = next_page																				last = 2

for all pages:
	get car desc
	get car prices
	process desc & prices
	append desc & prices to list

sort the list
save the list to a spreadsheet file

This is a good example of using selectors to find things, it's not so obvious 
   '''car_year = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector("[itemprop = releaseDate")
    car_make = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector("[itemprop = manufacturer")
    car_model = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector("[itemprop = model") '''
